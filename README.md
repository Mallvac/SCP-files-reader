# SCP-files-reader
Welcome !

I see that you found my little child ;)

This is browser file reader (set for scp files) used to read text files from github.
Easy As That !

For now it would be somewhat useless, but after some (of my) work you should be able
to link your repository and read your files.

# FAQ

Why I would use that ?
Idk ? Looks cool.

How do I use this ?
I would make help command and make documentation (If I won't be lazy enough).

# Post Scriptum
If you would be interested in this small project, just watch it unfold.
Who knows how powerful would it be ?
